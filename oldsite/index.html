<li  class="L3" >Added Forth Strings Library <ol>
<p  class="P4" >I have uploaded my old Forth-79/Forth-83 strings library
from the late '80s. It has been updated to work with modern
Forths like GFORTH.

<li  class="L3" >CORDIC Demo Added <ol>
<p  class="P4" >I've added a demo CORDIC program to compute basic trig
functions. It's written in Forth and should be easy to
understand and port to other languages. The implementation
is simple and efficient enough to use on small MCUs.

<li  class="L3" >Open-source utilities added <ol>
<p  class="P4" >I've put up the open-source software I've created for my own
use. You can find it in the new <a href="software.html">Software</a>
section. Most have to do with outlining using
<a href="http://www.vimoutliner.org">Vim Outliner</a>. Feel free to
(ab)use them as you see fit (as long as you honor the GPL).

<li  class="L3" >Lane Mountain Logic spins-off from Noel's Lab <ol>
<p  class="P4" >Website traffic over the last year has shown two major
audiences for Noel's Lab. The first is hobbyists, students
and experimenters. The second group is comprised mainly of
businesses seeking professional services.
</p>
<p  class="P4" >
If you're in the first group, congratulations. You have
chosen a fun, interesting and growing field of study. Noel's
Lab will continue to serve you in these endeavors. In fact
Noel's Lab is dropping all products and services so it can
more spend more time working with the
electronics/embedded/thinking communities.
</p>
<p  class="P4" >
If you're in the second group, you'll want to move along to
<a href="http://www.lmlogic.com">Lane Mountain Logic</a>. There you can
find circuit design, MCU programming and other engineering
services.
</p>
<p  class="P4" >
Please don't hesitate to let me know what you'd like to see. </p>
