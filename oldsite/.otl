			Lane Mountain Logic spins-off from Noel's Lab
				: Website traffic over the last year has shown two major 
				: audiences for Noel's Lab. The first is hobbyists, students 
				: and experimenters. The second group is comprised mainly of 
				: businesses seeking professional services. 
				:
				: If you're in the first group, congratulations. You have 
				: chosen a fun, interesting and growing field of study. Noel's 
				: Lab will continue to serve you in these endeavors. In fact 
				: Noel's Lab is dropping all products and services so it can 
				: more spend more time working with the 
				: electronics/embedded/thinking communities.
				:
				: If you're in the second group, you'll want to move along to 
				: [http://www.lmlogic.com Lane Mountain Logic]. There you can 
				: find circuit design, MCU programming and other engineering 
				: services.
				:
				: Please don't hesitate to let me know what you'd like to see.

		2005-11-05 - Troubleshooting Myth
			: Troubleshooting is a rare, innate ability that cannot be taught 
			: nor learned. Right? //Wrong!!!// Here is an excellent page on a real, 
			: teachable and learnable, troubleshooting method that really 
			: works. I have used these and similar techniques for decades.
			:
			: If you are a technician, engineer or regularly deal with system 
			: failures, you should definitely check this out.

		2005-10-20 - Vim Outliner rocks!
			: Yes, I know I work on the Vim Outliner project, but that doesn't 
			: take away from VO's usefulness. As a matter of fact, this entire 
			: web site was created with 
			: [http://www.vimoutliner.org Vim Outliner]. This web site is 
			: a single text outline file that is converted into a multi-page 
			: web site with some simple-to-use tools.
			:
			: Yes I also know I created these simple-to-use tools, but that 
			: doesn't mean they're not cool. One tool, otl2html.py, converts 
			: an outline into an html page. It supports headings, text, 
			: preformatted text, tables with headings and some simple 
			: beautification. You can get this tool from the VO web site: 
			: [http://www.vimoutliner.org www.vimoutliner.org].
			:
			: The other tool, which is not yet available to the public, is 
			: otlsplit. It splits a large outline into several smaller 
			: outlines. I use this tool to split my large website.otl file 
			: into several otl files that will, in turn, be converted to web 
			: pages. Look for this utility to appear soon on the VO website. 
			: Or if you can't wait, you can ask for a copy in the VO mailing 
			: list. You can join the list from the '//Participating//' link on 
			: the VO web site.
