<div class="MainPage">
<div class="Summary">
<ol>
<li  class="L1" >Summary <ol>
<p  class="P2" >Easy Backup is a simple shell script to backup data. The main advantage
over just using tar is that the archive is directly browseable. The
entire directory hierarchy remains intact. Only the files themselves are
compressed. </p>
</ol>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="Usage">
<ol>
<li  class="L1" >Usage <ol>
<pre  class="PRE2" > Usage: easybackup.sh &#91;burn&#93; command backupName </pre>
</ol>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="Commands">
<ol>
<li  class="L1" >Commands <ol>
<pre  class="PRE2" > burn             burns backups to DVD with growisofs
 full             perform a full backup
 incr             perform an incremental backup
 init             initializes a DVD for incremental backups
 -v, --version    show the version
 -h, --help       show this message
 --help-config    show configuration help
 --help-commands  show command examples
 --help-settings  show the current easybackup settings </pre>

</div>
<div class="Examples">
<ol>
<li  class="L1" >Examples <ol>
<pre  class="PRE2" > easybackup.sh full photos
         This command would backup all the files in
         /home/noel/backups/photos.inc while excluding
         all files in /home/noel/backups/photos.exc.
 easybackup.sh incr music
         This command would backup all the new files in
         /home/noel/backups/music.inc while excluding
         all files in /home/noel/backups/music.exc.
 easybackup.sh burn incr music
         This command would do the same as above but would
         also burn the contents, incrementally (growisofs -M),
         onto a DVD. </pre>
</ol>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="Configuration">
<ol>
<li  class="L1" >Configuration <ol>
<p  class="P2" >There are two types of configuration files. The first is optional.
It sets where easybackup.sh is to find backup configuration files
and where to store the backups. These files are /etc/easybackup.cfg
and $HOME/.easybackuprc. /etc/easybackup.cfg is read first, if it
exists. Then $HOME/.easybackuprc is read, if it exists. This allows
$HOME/.easybackuprc to override settings in /etc/easybacukp.cfg. If
neither file is present, easybackup.sh currently defaults to:
</p>
<pre  class="PRE2" >	backup configuration file location:  $HOME/backups
	backup data storage location:        $HOME/backups/data
	program to compress files:           gzip -9
	program to save incrementals:        growisofs -M /dev/dvdrw
</pre>
<p  class="P2" >Files of the second type determine what is to be included and what,
if anything, is to be skipped. These files have the suffix of .inc
for files to be included and .exc for files to be excluded. Wildcards
and partial entries are supported.
</p>
<pre  class="PRE2" > Example Configuration Files (for example, "myprojects")
 	Coniguration file myprojects.inc might include:
 		/home/noel/active
 		/home/noel/billing
 		/home/noel/clientDB
 	Coniguration file myprojects.exc might include:
 		*~
 		*.hex
 		*.cod
 		*.lst
 		*.BAK
 		active/.*/sandbox
 		vmware/data
</pre>
<pre  class="PRE2" >
 Example .easybackuprc
 	# Where to find my backup configuration files
 	BACKDIR=/home/noel/backups
 	# Where to store the backups created
 	DATADIR=/home/noel/backups/data
 	# backup (owner) information file
 	MYINFO="/home/noel/backups/data/info.txt"
 	# What compressor to use
 	ZIPPER="gzip -9"                        # my personal favorite
 	# ZIPPER="bzip2 -9"                     # another good option
 	# ZIPPER="zip -D -m {}.zip"             # for those M$ users
 	# how to burn a 'growing' DVD of incremental backups
 	INCRBURN="growisofs -M /dev/dvdrw -R -l"
 	# how to initialize and incremental (not for CDRW)
 	INITINCR="growisofs -Z /dev/dvdrw -R -l /home/noel/backups/data/info.txt"
 	# how to store full backups
 	FULLBURN="growisofs -Z /dev/dvdrw -R -l"
   (the above also applies to /etc/easybackup.cfg) </pre>
